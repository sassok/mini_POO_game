ILS VEULENT MA POO

Welcome to our interactive game, the first of a long series of copies that were generated by skilled, and yet poorly trained, students. 
You'll start as one of your own characters, witch will evolve in this binary world armed with a stick aimed at visious Jeannine's skull, along with other NPCs.

The game starts with a number of files.
The first one is the very obvious "app.rb", a launchable you can perform in your iterm app (or any other obuntu-like crap) using the "ruby app.rb" line.

The fun game starts using the "app_2.rb" that throws you in this uncanny world were you can actually build your persona and then throw it against our vicious NPCs.
Until death does one of you apart.

Finally, the "app_3.rb" app will put you up agains hords of raging NPCs that will aim at you.
Feel free to aim first, and have the best of fun !
